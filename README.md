# Getting started

1. Make sure you have Node installed using nvm as this is an nvm project
2. run `nvm use` to make sure you're running the correct version of Node
3. then run `npm install`
4. To run this project you will need ssl certificates, locally generated is fine
5. Generated your `.crt` and `.key` files and place them in the /certificats folder
6. Next you will need the environmental variables, ask another developer for the `.env` file
7. place the `.env` file in the root of your project
8. finally run `npm run dev-ssl` which runs dev-server.js

# This is a NextJS app

1. If you have never built a nextjs project, take a look at `https://nextjs.org/docs`

It's basically a server side rendering system for reactjs
